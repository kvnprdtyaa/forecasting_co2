# Forecasting CO2 Levels

## Overview

The `forecasting_co2` project aims to analyze and predict carbon dioxide (CO2) levels using historical data. This project utilizes various forecasting techniques to provide insights into CO2 trends and future projections, which can be crucial for environmental studies and policy-making.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing from reliable sources.
- Implementation of various forecasting models (ARIMA).
- Visualization of CO2 trends and forecasts.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvnprdtyaa/forecasting_co2.git
cd forecasting_co2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run prediksi_co2.py
```

## Data Sources

The project uses historical CO2 data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitshirudkar/air-quality-forecasting-co2-emissions) datasets.
